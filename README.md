Syft Hackathon 2023 - Round 3 Solution

## Value Proposition
For the project, I have opted to create a miniature version of an SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  

### Streamlined Operations
The website offers a centralized platform for managing various aspects of the business, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency. This includes managing invoices, payments, customer information, supplier data, and inventory.

### Enhanced Financial Control
One of the primary goals of this system is to provide Jodi with better control over financial data. The system allows for recording transactions and presenting all financial information. 

### Real-time Data Insights
The application includes interactive dashboards that displays key business data and analytics in real-time. This provides Jodi with valuable insights into the company's performance.

### Inventory Management
The system includes an inventory management application that helps keep track of stock levels. It allows for the efficient management of inventory, ensuring that the company can meet customer demand while minimizing waste.

### Transaction Management
The application enables the creation and storage of transactions and related details, simplifying the process of recording and managing invoices and payments. This feature not only improves accuracy but also saves time by automating repetitive tasks.

### Data Augmentation
While the system is initially populated with existing transaction data, it offers the flexibility to augment data as needed. Jodi can create new transactions, update customer and supplier information, and adapt the system to evolving business needs.
